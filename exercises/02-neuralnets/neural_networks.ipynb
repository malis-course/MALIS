    "1. Be familiar with the elements required to define the architecture of a neural network (NN).\n",
    "2. Understand the two procedures needed to train a neural network: feedforward and backpropagation\n",
    "3. Understand the role of the learning rate and the number of iterations in the training process of a NN and how it these can affect performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Instructions:\n",
    "Experiments should be made by groups of two students. Each group should produce a Jupyter Notebook with all their results and comments. We strongly encourage the addition of plots and visual representation to the report, bearing in mind that comments on the graphical data are still necessary.

    "2. A \"programming\" part: Given the skeleton of the Python code of an MLP simulator, implement the missing functions (feedforward and backpropagation procedures). \n",

    "3. An \"experimental\" part: Having completed the implementation of the MLP simulator, the final step consist on training the network and testing it.\n",

    "The aim of this part is to get a better understanding of the basics of Neural Networks construction. A number of sample points on a 128 by 128 grid have been assigned one out of three colors (red, green or blue). You should build a Neural Network with two inputs and three outputs which provides the exact coloring for these points. The problem can be visualized in the following figure: \n",
