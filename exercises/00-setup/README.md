# Setup

This tutorial is designed to get you familiarized with python and some of the core libraries we will be using during the course:

The tutorial contains three parts:

1. [Using Git and Git repositories](./git.md)
2. [Setting a local Python environment](./python.md)
3. [Working with Jupyter Notebooks and Jupyter Lab](./jupyter.md)

Once you have gone through all the steps of the tutorial, run the [check_setup.ipynb](./check_setup.ipynb) notebook to verify that your environment has been correctly configured.
