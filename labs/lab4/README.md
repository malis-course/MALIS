# Lab 3: Decision Trees and Recap

The aim of this lab session is to practice with decision trees for classification and then comparing different classification algorithms.

This lab is divided into 2 parts
1. Implementing and testing a decision tree structure [Go to notebook](./decision_trees.ipynb)
2. Compare different classification algorithms on the same dataset [Go to notebook](./comparison.ipynb)

### Learning goals

After this lab, you should be able to:

1. Have a clear understanding of decision trees, how to implement them, their trengths and weaknesses
2. identify the key differences between the different family of classifiers covered in the course
