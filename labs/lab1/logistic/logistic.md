# Part 2: Logistic Regression

In this part of the lab, you will get familiar with the practical use of the logistic regression and you will put in place a learning pipeline for logistic regression. 

### Learning goals

After running this notebook, you should be able to:

1. Interpret the coefficent estimates produced by a logistic regression model
2. Identify the building blocks of a pipeline to make building, fitting, and tracking models easier
3. Be able to make an informed choice of model based on the data at hand
4. Be familiar with the scikit-learn implementation of logistic regression

### Hands-On
Open the [Logistic Regression Jupyter notebook](./logistic.ipynb) and start working on the required tasks.
