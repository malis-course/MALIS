    "# A Quick Introduction to pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will get familiar with the minimal set of features from pandas that will render you operational for this course. If you want to dig deeper into the library, you can follow any of these tutorials:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [W3School Pandas Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas/)\n",
    "2. [Pandas Kaggle Course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/pandas)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Brief Introduction\n",
    "[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is a Python library used for working with data sets. It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data in a fast, powerful and flexible way. It is built on top of NumPy. The name \"pandas\" is s short version of \"Python for Data Analysis\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Features\n",
    "Some of the main features of pandas include:\n",
    "* Easy handling of missing data (represented as NaN) in floating point as well as non-floating point data\n",
    "* Size mutability: columns can be inserted and deleted from DataFrame and higher dimensional objects\n",
    "* Automatic and explicit data alignment: objects can be explicitly aligned to a set of labels, or the user can simply ignore the labels and let Series, DataFrame, etc. automatically align the data for you in computations\n",
    "* Powerful, flexible group by functionality to perform split-apply-combine operations on data sets, for both aggregating and transforming data\n",
    "* Make it easy to convert ragged, differently-indexed data in other Python and NumPy data structures into DataFrame objects\n",
    "* Intelligent label-based slicing, fancy indexing, and subsetting of large data sets\n",
    "* Intuitive merging and joining datasets\n",
    "* Flexible reshaping and pivoting of datasets\n",
    "* Hierarchical labeling of axes (possible to have multiple labels per tick)\n",
    "* Robust IO tools for loading data from flat files (CSV and delimited), Excel files, databases, and saving/loading data from the ultrafast HDF5 format\n",
    "* Time series-specific functionality: date range generation and frequency conversion, moving window statistics, moving window linear regressions, date shifting and lagging, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. The Basics\n",
    "As with other libraries, the first step to work with pandas is to import it"

    "* `describe()` generates descriptive statistics, such as the mean, standard deviation, mean, max and quartiles for numerical columns (default). By using the argument `include=\"all\"` it also provides statistics for non-numerical columns (e.g top value, frequency or count)."
