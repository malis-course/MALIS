# Lab 2: Gradient Descent

In this lab session, you will gain practical knowledge on gradient descent.

The lab is divided into two parts:

1. [Part 1: Solving Linear Regression](./lr/lin_reg_solver.ipynb)
2. [Part 2: Solving Logistic Regression](./lr/log_reg_solver.ipynb)


### Learning goals

After this lab, you should be able to:

1. Have a clear understanding of gradient descent, how it works and how it is implemented
2. Understanding the role of the learning rate and the number of epochs in finding a solution
